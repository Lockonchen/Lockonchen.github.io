\[Abstract\] The filter function formalism was originally introduced to describe the decay of phase coherence under dynamical decoupling sequences. It was later extended to describe the fidelity of noisy gate operations for single or multiple qubits using the Magnus expansion. In recent years, people became interested in the spectral characterization of environmental noise and cross-correlated properties during various quantum processes. In this presentation, I will shortly summarize the history of filter function formalism and discuss an examplary experimental work on two-qubit spectroscopy conducted at 2020.
